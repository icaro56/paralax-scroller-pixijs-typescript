## BUILDING A PARALLAX SCROLLER WITH PIXI.JS

This is my Typescript converted code of the paralax tutorial: http://www.yeahbutisitflash.com/?p=7046

## Commands:

-   `npm run build` - starts build procedure
-   `npm run dev` - start watching for files and open's server on localhost:8080
-   `npm run test` - run tests
-   `npm run code-coverage` - generate code coverage report
-   `npm run code-style-check` - run's eslint and prettier check on your code

For vscode users - ctrl ( or âŒ˜ ) + shift + b will run the watch build as its set as default vscode task

## Production

After execute the command `npm run build`, enter in folder `dist` using a Terminal and execute the command `http-server`
